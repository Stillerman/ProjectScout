## ProjectScout

ProjectScout is a library designed to prepare a codebase for ingestion with an LLM. It provides tools to analyze directory contents, offering insights into file structures, token counts, and more

## Features

- **Print Tokens:** Display the directory structure along with token counts for each file.
- **Print Structure:** Print the directory structure without file contents.
- **Print All:** Print the folder structure along with the contents of each file.
- **Search Project:** Search for a specific pattern within the entire project.
- **Modify File:** Modify the contents of a specified file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/stillerman/ProjectScout
    cd ProjectScout
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

1. **Print Tokens:**
    ```sh
    python cli.py print-tokens [DIRECTORY] [OPTIONS]
    ```
    Options:
    - `--large, -l [N]` : Show the top N largest files with the most tokens.
    
    Example:
    ```sh
    python cli.py print-tokens ./my_project --large 5
    ```

2. **Print Structure:**
    ```sh
    python cli.py print-structure [DIRECTORY]
    ```

    Example:
    ```sh
    python cli.py print-structure ./my_project
    ```

3. **Print All:**
    ```sh
    python cli.py print-all [DIRECTORY]
    ```

    Example:
    ```sh
    python cli.py print-all ./my_project
    ```

4. **Search Project:**
    ```sh
    python cli.py search-project [DIRECTORY] [PATTERN]
    ```

    Example:
    ```sh
    python cli.py search-project ./my_project "TODO"
    ```

5. **Modify File:**
    ```sh
    python cli.py modify-file [FILE_PATH] [CONTENT]
    ```

    Example:
    ```sh
    python cli.py modify-file ./my_project/file.txt "New content for the file."
    ```

## Detailed Description

### Token Counting
ProjectScout uses the GPT-4 tokenizer to count tokens in text files. This feature helps in identifying the token distribution across files, which is particularly useful for projects involving natural language processing and machine learning.

### Directory Structure Printing
This library can print the directory structure of a given directory. It can also include token counts for each file and display the contents of the files. This makes it easier to get an overview of the project's structure and content.

### Project Search
You can search for specific patterns within the project, making it easy to locate references to certain functions, variables, or comments across the codebase.

### File Modification
ProjectScout also includes a command to modify the contents of a specified file, allowing for quick updates and changes directly from the command line.
